World wide web includes everything, but some papers are hidden from society or hard to reach.
With OPENPAPERS  we will encourage authorities to share treaties, white papers, and other papers on our
website as open-source, completely free and transparent.
We will also summarize long papers to make the public understand papers more clearly.
