# OpenPapers
The website for a project

## Usage
Open terminal, run `npm install`, and then run `npm start` to see the website locally.

## Deployment
The site is automatically deployed to **GitHub Pages** from the `main` branch. Every push runs a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the static files with Gulp and publishes them to the `gh-pages` environment.
